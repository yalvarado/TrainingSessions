SESSION 00
------------------------------------------------------------------
0.- In visual studio, create a project of type Console App

1.- Create an Animal class that can be instanciated by passing two parameters, the animal's type as a string ("lion", "zebra", "dog", "cat", ...) and the animal's name (also as a string) ("John","Kate","Ali",...).

2.- Amend the Animal class so that it ALSO allows to be instanciated by passing only one parameter, the animal's type and using "John" as the default name.

3.- Add a public method called 

public void DescribeMe() 
{}

That will print out to the screen the following message:

"I am a XXX and my name is YYY"

Where XXX will be the animal's type and YYY will be the animal's name.

TIP: In order to write something to the screen you can use:

Console.Writeline("This will be printed out to the console!!")

It may be a good idea to use:  Console.Readline()
to stop the execution of the application until the user presses a key or the console will close up before you can see the results.
