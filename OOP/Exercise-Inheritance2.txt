Grandpa always had three habits 

Grandpa takes the rubbish out
Grandpa rides a bicycle
Grandpa likes one specific food
Grandpa likes one specific fruit

Grandpa's children "Mom" and "uncle" inherit grandpa's habits.

Mom implements:
`LikesOneSpecificFood`
and
`RidesABicycle`



Uncle implements:
`TakeTheRubbishOut`
and
`LikesOneSpecificFruit`

The grandchild (“Son”), inherits all the behaviors from his Mom. But he also takes the rubbish out like his Uncle.

Please, complete the class that shows Son's behavior. Grandpa is an Interface declaring some methods. Mom and Uncle are classes that implement  Grandpa's methods. Son is the class you have to complete.


Below is the implementation of the four methods


```void TakeTheRubbishOut()
{
   Console.Writeline("takes the rubbish out");
}

void RidesABicycle()
{
   Console.Writeline("Rides a bicycle");
}

void LikesOneSpecificFood()
{
   Console.Writeline("Likes one specific food");
}

void LikesOneSpecificFruit()
{
   Console.Writeline("Likes one specific fruit");
}```
