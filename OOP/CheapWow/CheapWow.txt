As that one is very easy I thought we could start working on a project that will be expanding over time... Cheap and Dirty WorldOfWarcraft  :slightly_smiling_face:

Initially, it'll be a .netCore Console app, over time we'll make it an MVC website.

So let's start with creating a RandomGenerator Class that we'll use extensively throughout our application.

Create a folder call `Helpers` and add the RandomGenerator.cs class in there:

```    public interface IRandomGenerator
    {
        int GetRandomNumber(int min, int max);
    }

    public class RandomGenerator : IRandomGenerator
    {
        private static readonly Random _randomInstance = new Random();
        
        public int GetRandomNumber(int min, int max)
        {
            return _randomInstance.Next(min, max);
        }

    }```
 

Random is a .net class, so why are we creating a wrapper for that class instead of using it directly?
